# Program Description: An application to calculate a spam score for an email message using trigger phrases.

## Function: auditor
Rates the likelihood that a message is spam based on its spam score.

Parameters:
    score (int): Total spam score returned by the scanner function.

Logic:
    1. If score is 0, message is likely safe.
    2. If score is 1, message might be spam.
    3. If score is 2, message is probably spam.
    4. If score is 3 or higher, message is very likely spam.

Return:
    str: A spam likelihood rating message.

## Function: normalizer
Normalizes text by converting to lower case, replacing punctuation with spaces,
and collapsing extra whitespace into single spaces. This creates a consistent
format for comparing trigger phrases against user input.

Parameters:
    message (str): The input text to be normalized.

Variables:
    punctuation (list): Characters to replace with whitespace.
    ch (str): A single punctuation character from the punctuation list.

Logic:
    1. Convert the message to lower case.
    2. Replace each punctuation symbol in the list with a space.
    3. Collapse all extra whitespace into single spaces.
    4. Return the cleaned message.

Return:
    str: The normalized version of the input message.

## Function: prompter
Prompts the user to enter an email message, normalizes the message,
scans it for spam trigger phrases, and prints the results.

Parameters:
    None

Variables:
    message (str): Raw message input entered by the user.
    clean_message (str): Normalized message after removing punctuation,
                         collapsing whitespace, and converting to lower case.
    score (int): Total spam score based on trigger phrase occurrences.
    hits (list): List of (phrase, occurrences) tuples for matched phrases.
    rating (str): Spam likelihood message based on score.

Logic:
    1. Prompt the user to enter an email message.
    2. Normalize the message (lowercase, remove punctuation, collapse spaces).
    3. Pass the cleaned message to the scanner function to calculate score/hits.
    4. Pass the score to the auditor function to determine the spam rating.
    5. Display the spam score, rating, and matched phrases.

Return:
    None

## Function: scanner
Scans a normalized email message for spam trigger phrases and calculates
a spam score based on the number of occurrences of each trigger phrase.

Parameters:
    message (str): A normalized email message (lower case, punctuation removed,
                   and whitespace collapsed).

Variables:
    scam_score (int): Accumulates one point per occurrence of trigger phrases.
    hits (list): Collects matched phrases and their occurrence counts.
    phrase (str): A trigger phrase from the triggers list.
    clean_phrase (str): Normalized version of the trigger phrase.
    occurrences (int): Number of times clean_phrase occurs in message.

Logic:
    1. Initialize scam_score to 0 and hits to an empty list.
    2. Loop through each phrase in the triggers list.
    3. Normalize the phrase to match the same format as the message.
    4. Count the number of occurrences of the phrase in the message.
    5. Add occurrences to scam_score.
    6. If occurrences > 0, store (phrase, occurrences) in hits.
    7. Return the final scam_score and hits list.

Return:
    tuple: (int, list) The scam score and a list of matched phrases with counts.
