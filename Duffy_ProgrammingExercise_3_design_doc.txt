# Technical Design Document: Duffy_ProgrammingExercise_3

# Name: Duffy, Michael
# Date: February 22, 2026
# Program Description: A program that collects monthly expenses and uses reduce to display the total, highest, and lowest expense.

## Function: calculator
Analyzes a list of monthly expense records and calculates summary statistics.

Parameters:
    expenses (list): A list of expense records, where each record is [name (str), amount (float)].

Variables:
    total (float): The sum of all monthly expense amounts.
    max_record (list): The single expense record with the highest amount (first wins ties).
    min_record (list): The single expense record with the lowest amount (first wins ties).
    max_amount (float): The highest amount used to detect ties.
    min_amount (float): The lowest amount used to detect ties.
    max_ties (list): All records tied for the highest amount in entry order.
    min_ties (list): All records tied for the lowest amount in entry order.

Logic:
    1. Return safe empty results if the list of expenses is empty.
    2. Use functools.reduce to sum all amounts into a total.
    3. Use functools.reduce to select the record with the highest amount (first wins ties).
    4. Use functools.reduce to select the record with the lowest amount (first wins ties).
    5. Collect all records tied for the highest amount.
    6. Collect all records tied for the lowest amount.
    7. Return the calculated values.

Return:
    tuple: (total, max_record, min_record, max_ties, min_ties)

## Function: inquisitor
Prompts the user to enter monthly expenses as name-and-amount records.

Parameters:
    None

Variables:
    expenses (list): Stores all entered records as [name, amount].
    record (list): Stores one expense record as [name, amount].
    record_name (str): The expense name entered by the user.
    record_amount (str): The raw amount input entered by the user before conversion.
    amount (float): The validated monthly amount rounded to two decimals.

Logic:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store expense records.
    2. Loop until the user presses Enter on an expense name.
    3. Validate and convert the amount to a float rounded to two decimals.
    4. Reject invalid numbers and reject amounts less than $0.01.
    5. Append each completed record to the list.
    6. Return the list of expense records.

Return:
    list: The list of expense records entered by the user.

## Function: main
Runs the monthly budget calculator by collecting input, analyzing expenses, and printing results.

Parameters:
    None

Variables:
    expenses (list): The list of expense records returned by inquisitor().
    total (float): The monthly total returned by calculator().
    max_record (list): The single highest expense record returned by calculator().
    min_record (list): The single lowest expense record returned by calculator().
    max_ties (list): The list of records tied for highest amount returned by calculator().
    min_ties (list): The list of records tied for lowest amount returned by calculator().
    record (list): A record used when printing tied results.

Logic:
    1. Print program instructions.
    2. Collect expense records from the user.
    3. Handle the case where no expenses are entered.
    4. Call calculator() to compute totals and extremes using reduce.
    5. Print the total, highest, and lowest expenses with labels and currency formatting.
    6. Print tied records when more than one record shares the max or min amount.

Return:
    None
